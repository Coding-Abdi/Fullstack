    <p><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/best-first-programming-language" target="_blank">Programming</a> is a profession that uses a deep roster of languages, database models, frameworks, and much<br> more. In addition, different classifications exist within these tools, such as high-level and low-level<br> programming languages. With all the technologies and types out there, it can be challenging for a student<br> to decipher not only what to be learning, but also <strong>how to be learning</strong>.</p>

    <p>Many people gain their programming education through universities and leave with a shiny piece of paper<br> vouching for their skills. Despite what tradition may imply, college is not the right path for many developing<br> programmers, <strong>and the industry knows it</strong>. Factors such as expenses, responsibilities, and other obstacles<br> that appear in all of our lives can put college out of reach for some people. Add to that the recent explosion<br> in online learners and resources, and many hiring managers have recognized that college is not the<br> end-all-be-all it is advertised as.</p>

    <p>If you can learn to code well (and can prove it), you can become a programmer with any educational<br> background! Today, we'll help demystify this kind of <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/project-management-tips-for-self-taught-devs" target="_blank">self-taught journey</a> by going in-depth about why such<br> a goal is attainable, various learning options, and strategies to prove programming skills.</p>

    <h1 id="do_it">You can do it!</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="seven">
    <p>Before you can successfully learn programming outside of the university environment, it is critical that you<br> understand that <strong>your goal is immensely attainable</strong>. As mentioned in our <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/stackoverflow-dev-survey-key-takeaways-learners#education" target="_blank">key takeaways from the 2022<br> Stack Overflow survey</a>, around 23% of professional developers in 2022 are working without a degree. The<br> number of students learning to program with online resources is increasing every year, and so is the number<br> of new industry professionals with no bachelor's degree.</p>

    <p>Not only do you have the ability to learn everything you need to become a professional developer with online<br> resources and platforms, but you also have a real <strong>opportunity to pursue employment</strong> with whatever<br> educational background you may have. Programming is an occupation where <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/tips-self-taught-developers" target="_blank">constant learning and growth</a><br> is a shared trait between the most senior and newest employees. A degree is not a prevailing indication that<br> all knowledge has been obtained. No matter what degree you hold, you will be a student for the rest of your<br> career in order to keep up with the unpredictable industry of technology.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="eight">
    <h1 id="cs_degree">Why a computer science degree is not the right<br> choice for everybody</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="nine">
    <p>Since every programmer is inherently a learner, the most expensive and time-consuming learning option is<br> not necessarily the optimal option for every future programmer out there. University tuition in the United<br> States has been on the rise<a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/college-tuition-inflation" target="_blank">[1]</a> for the past few decades, with no sign of slowing down.</p>

    <p>Even with available scholarships and loans, pursuing a traditional bachelor's degree (let alone a more<br> advanced degree) is a costly and debt-inducing venture for a lot of students. If budgeting for a bachelor's<br> degree is not feasible for you at this time, there is no need to feel hopeless as you can learn the <strong>exact same<br> material and skills via different paths</strong>. A truly great gift of our internet age is that information and<br> education are no longer reserved for the select few who can pay hefty tuition fees.</p>

    <p>The common university environment is also not the ideal situation for every learner. Suppose you're<br> reskilling from another profession, learning part-time with family obligations, or need to work part-time<br> while learning to become a programmer. In that case, the rigorous curriculum of a college course isn't <br>necessarily the best choice. The flexibility to learn at your own pace (at a fraction of the cost) while being<br> able to focus on the other essential tasks is a huge upside to individual learning.</p>

    <p>Many capable people <strong>don't thrive in the traditional educational environment</strong> of a single instructor<br> assigning tests, materials, and assignments. Rather than compete for the individual attention of the<br> professor against an army of confused peers, many people find it much easier to be in charge of how<br> they're learning. Online learning provides a great option for eager students who have always felt more<br> comfortable learning outside of the classroom setting.</p>

    <p>Beyond all the personal reasons why college may not be the perfect learning option for you, it is key to<br> remember that <strong>you don't need to force the university system to work for you</strong> if it isn't working, or won't<br> work for you. There are other viable roads to achieving the education you desire that operate at your own<br> speed. Even better, programmers are learning and getting hired every day from these alternate educational<br> platforms!</p>

    <div class="ten">
    <h1 id="learning_options">Learning options and how to prove your<br> knowledge</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="eleven">
    <p>There are <strong>several popular options for learning</strong> outside of the university bubble. By completing a<br> combination of courses, certifications, projects, and/or boot camps you will not only learn the same skills<br> as a university student would learn, but you will also receive reliable documentation to prove that you've<br> learned them. At the beginning of your journey, it is beneficial to mix a variety of these resources in your<br> routine to get a sense of what blend <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/5-proven-learning-strategies" target="_blank">works best for you</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="twelve">
    <h1 id="online_courses">Online courses</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="thirteen">
    <p>Online courses allow students to take courses produced by industry experts looking to share their<br> knowledge with the next wave of programmers. Some sought-after qualities of a <strong>reputable course<br> provider</strong> are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Text-based and interactive environments/coursework</li>
        <li>Personalized learning plans</li>
        <li>Skill-level assessments</li>
        <li>Reinforcing quizzes</li>
        <li>Informative visuals</li>
        <li>Detailed interview preparation</li>
        <li>A variety of courses and paths for students of all levels</li>
        <li>Relevant coursework for all chapters of your learning journey and career</li>
        <li>Courses produced by experienced industry professionals and/or educators</li>
        
    </ul>

    <p>Structured courses and paths leave no mystery about what is prerequisite knowledge and what to be<br> learning next (and how to learn it). A successful online course will present the same information, and teach<br> it in a similar fashion, as you would learn in undergraduate computer science programs. Learning from<br> online courses will take some more self-motivation without grades and deadlines to worry about, but it's<br> worth it since you'll be gaining the same education <strong>at your own pace</strong>, and at a much cheaper price.</p>

    <p>Even after you've secured a job as a programmer, online courses are still of value. <strong>Professional developers<br> need to upskill constantly</strong> to keep up with the fluctuating tech world, so getting into the habit of taking<br> online courses — especially ones that are created specifically for developers — is a great idea that will<br> benefit your career for years to come! Having access to a plethora of online courses also makes it possible<br> to pick up a new skill or language whenever you please. If you're someone who loves learning, then this<br> boundless resource is sure to speak to you.</p>

    <div class="fourteen">
    <h2 id="certifications">Certifications</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="fifteen">
    <p>Working towards certifications is a fantastic way to <strong>practice your craft while gaining documented<br> experience</strong>. A great place to start looking for developer certifications is at companies such as <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/microservices-in-azure" target="_blank">Microsoft</a><br> and <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/crack-gcp-certification-exam" target="_blank">Google</a>. Passing an exam to achieve a certificate focused on a reputable company's preferred<br> technology demonstrates to employers that you have obtained the necessary skills and knowledge.</p>

    <p>For example, passing Amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner" target="_blank">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification</a> indicates foundational<br> fluency in cloud technology and <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/crack-aws-certification-exam" target="_blank">AWS</a>. Other companies that use the cloud computing services of AWS<br> would view that certification as a huge plus on a resume. To continue displaying AWS knowledge, <strong>keep<br> completing higher-level certifications as your skills grow</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sixteen">
    <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="seventeen">
    <p>Sometimes, <strong>the best way to learn is by doing</strong>. Working on open-source projects across the programming<br> community is ideal for proving your worth as a programmer in the form of a tangible contribution.<br> They're also outstanding for providing an environment to practice hands-on with the concepts you've been<br> learning about. <a href="https://github.com/topics/projects" target="_blank">GitHub</a> provides a platform to dive into programming projects in various languages and<br> collaborate with a community of open-source developers.</p>

    <p>Projects you complete on your own are another option for getting real-world experience. For example, you<br> can build different kinds of websites and web apps or complete tutorials and projects you find online while<br> storing your code in GitHub repositories. Doing this kind of solo work in addition to contributing to<br> open-source projects can <strong>show off an ability to work on your own</strong>, as well as complete projects from the<br> idea stage to the finished product.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="eighteen">
    <h2 id="bootcamps">Bootcamps</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="nineteen">
    <p>If you want to learn popular technologies and skills with a rigorous curriculum in a short time (for a fraction<br> of the cost of tuition), then <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/coding-bootcamp-formula-interviewboost" target="_blank">attending bootcamps</a> is a reliable option to consider. Bootcamps range from<br> $7,800 to $21,000<a href="https://www.coursereport.com/blog/coding-bootcamp-cost-comparison-full-stack-immersives" target="_blank">[2]</a>, with the average full-time coding boot camp costing around $13,584, and expected<br> completion is usually around 14 weeks.</p>

    <p>These camps focus on providing <strong>extensive hands-on practice</strong> with the newest and most relevant practices,<br> technologies, and languages. Bootcamps tend to focus on specific languages, technologies, or career paths.<br> For example, you can find boot camps specifically for front-end web developers and some just for back-end<br> web developers. Attending a bootcamp is like working a full-time job, so make sure you <strong>budget your time</strong><br> and bandwidth accordingly before embarking on this path.</p>

    <p>Much like a computer science degree, completing a bootcamp is not the single solution to all your learning.<br> Bootcamps are a <strong>great resource to supplement with other learning options</strong> because of their specificity,<br> but 14 weeks of practice is not going to provide you with the education you need to enter the workforce. It's<br> important to continue your learning with other resources after the bootcamp has been completed to maintain<br> and increase your knowledge.</p>
