        <p>What exactly is a computer programmer? Computer programmers write code. They write code to design programs. <br> This may sound vague, but computer programming is a vast field with many different specializations. In order to<br> effectively include all of the database managers, web developers, systems analysts, and application devs, it is easier<br> to group them under the umbrella of “computer programmers.”</p>
        
        <p>If you love writing code, computer programming might be for you. In this article we'll discuss steps it takes to become<br> a computer programmer. We;ll break down each step in detail so you'll have a better understanding of what the work<br> itself will look like. You may have seen some of our longer guides on finding a job in the tech industry like <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/how-to-become-a-full-stack-developer" target="_blank">How to<br> become a full-stack developer</a> or <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/data-engineer-career" target="_blank">How to become a data engineer</a>. This article will cover similar steps to these guides,<br> but we'll dive a little deeper into the weeds of each one.</p>

        <p>Coders don't necessarily have to be professionals to be considered computer programmers. There are plenty of hobbyists<br> out there that, according to our definition of computer programming, make the grade. Even so, we'll focus on the path to<br> finding a computer programming career.</p>

        <p>If your aim is to be a hobby programmer, you'll still need a plan and an education, but you'll probably have different goals past those points.</p>

        <h2>Computer programmer vs software engineer</h2>

        <img src="https://www.educative.io/api/page/6476200228945920/image/download/4508013950140416" width="350" height="250">

        <p>To the uninitiated, computer science and software engineering describe two very similar disciplines. In reality, these two<br> fields are completely different. Computer science is centered around learning general computational principles and applying<br> them to a range of fields like machine learning, database management, and information security. Software engineering on the<br> other hand is engineering oriented and revolves around the practical skills necessary to design, develop, and maintain software<br> systems.</p>

        <p>Similarly, the role of a computer programmer and a software engineer are quite different. As previously mentioned, programmers<br> typically work in a more specialized area of the development process. They are responsible for writing code and building software.<br> Software engineers are still very much involved in the development process, but they are more likely to oversee broader areas as well.<br> Software engineers are often responsible for conception of an idea, troubleshooting, and implementation as well as development.</p>

        <p>It is important for all programmers to have a solid understanding of mathematics in addition to their ability to read, write,<br> and debug code in multiple programming languages.</p>

        <p>Coders and computer programmers occupy a unique position in the job market. It is common for large high-paying organizations to not<br> require a computer programming degree or other bespoke education requirements. As long as you present the hiring team with a resume<br> and portfolio of projects you've worked on, and are able to pass a technical interview, many companies don't care if you <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/how-to-become-a-programmer-with-no-degree" target="_blank">don't have a degree</a>.</p>

        <p>Many programmers that love writing code avoid engineering-focused roles as they will spend less time actively coding.</p>

        <h2>What kind of programmer do you want to be?</h2>

        <img src="https://www.educative.io/api/page/6476200228945920/image/download/6657692645195776" width="400" height="300">

        <p>There are so many different flavors of programming that if you love to code, it may be daunting to determine what you want to pursue as a career.<br> The best way to find out what you like to try as much as you can.</p>

        <p>Just a few types of programmer jobs to look into are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Software application development</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/beginner-guide-to-web-dev" target="_blank">Web development</a></li>
            <li>Front end, back-end, and full-stack</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/exploring-data-science-with-microsofts-applied-ai-engineer" target="_blank">Data science</a> and <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/machine-learning-for-data-science" target="_blank">machine learning</a></li>
            <li>Software application development</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/database-design-tutorial" target="_blank">Database administrator</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each of these disciplines require slightly different skills. Seek out as much as you can with respect to all the different fields, and remember<br> that nothing is set in stone. If, in your education, you find that web development is not what you find interesting and would prefer to spend<br> your time training artificial intelligence and studying neural networks, allow yourself the the time to pivot. The world of computer programming<br> is so diverse that it can be hard to find a niche, but it is very rewarding once you settle.</p>
